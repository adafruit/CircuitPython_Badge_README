Welcome to CircuitPython!
#############################

Hello PyCon - we wanted to have a fun ~electronic~ item, that
does more than just a sticker! What you have in your hand is a special 
edition Circuit Playground Express, brought to you by Adafruit and Digi-Key.

This hardware comes pre-loaded with CircuitPython! CircuitPython is Adafruit's
branch of MicroPython designed to simplify experimentation and education on 
low-cost microcontrollers. It makes it easier than ever to get prototyping 
by requiring no upfront desktop software downloads.

With CircuitPython you can write clean and simple Python 3 code to control 
hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages like C or C++ 
(what Arduino uses for programming). It's great for beginners and is powerful
for experts.

Enjoy PyCon 2019!

Thanks!
  - the Adafruit and Digi-Key teams

The Circuit Playground Express has limited disk space so we have disabled Mac OS X indexing
which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index 
or .Trashes files!

CircuitPython Quick Start:

Changing the code is as easy as editing main.py in your favorite text editor. 

Our recommended editor is Mu, which is great for simple projects, and comes
with a built in REPL serial viewer! It is available for Mac, Windows & Linux
https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the latest 
code.

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information, 
better error messages and an interactive CircuitPython (known as the REPL). 
On Windows we recommend Mu, Tera Term or PuTTY. 
On Mac OSX and Linux, use Mu or 'screen' can be used from a terminal.
