Welcome to EDGE BADGE CircuitPython and Machine Learning!
#############################

Hello Hackaday Superconference!

What you have in your hand is an Adafruit multi-mode EDGE BADGE with special thanks to Digi-Key 
for making it possible for 500 of these to make it to the event!
	https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400

This device is a Python-powered name badge out out-of-the-box (just edit code.py to personalize!) AND it's also a BRAINCRAFT 
machine learning badge that runs TensorFlow lite for microncontrollers. This is real machine 
learning on the edge, and it's wearable!

THANK YOU Dig-Key!

This hardware comes pre-loaded with CircuitPython! CircuitPython is Adafruit's branch of MicroPython designed to 
simplify experimentation and education on low-cost microcontrollers. It makes it easier than ever to get 
prototyping by requiring no upfront desktop software downloads.

With CircuitPython you can write clean and simple Python 3 code to control hardware instead of having to use complex 
low-level languages like C or C++ (what Arduino uses for programming). It's great for beginners and is powerful 
for experts.

On the device there are images and code to get started:

code.py  is the slideshow that runs the badge code, edit the name and URL to personalize it.
supercon.bmp is the bitmap image you can change to whatever you'd like 160 x 128 pixels.

Whichever file is named "code.py" is the one that runs, change the name to change the program. 
once saved the device automatically restarted and runs that code!

Enjoy Hackaday Superconference!

Thanks!
  - the Adafruit team

*ONE MORE THING - here is a special discount code for attendees at hackaday supercon,

The EDGE BADGE has limited disk space so we have disabled Mac OS X indexing which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index or .Trashes files!

CircuitPython Quick Start:

Changing the code is as easy as editing code.py in your favorite code or text editor. 

Our recommended editor is Mu, which is great for simple projects, and comes with a built in REPL serial viewer! 
It is available for Mac, Windows & Linux

	https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor/
	https://codewith.mu/

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the latest code.

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information, better error messages and an 
interactive CircuitPython (known as the REPL). On Windows we recommend Mu, Tera Term or PuTTY. 

On Mac OSX and Linux, use Mu or 'screen' can be used from a terminal.
